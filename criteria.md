# Part 1:

## Mission​ (should you choose to accept): Create a user interface based on the information provided from start to finish in your stack of choice.

### Problem Statement:​ A client has asked us to solve a problem for them. They are gathering a lot of information about issues at their buildings (i.e. “Hole in the wall”, or “Carpet needs to be replaced”). In order to prioritize and budget for these issues they want to provide their field technicians a tool to ​estimate the cost of repair​. What they asked for was a simple interface to build an estimate on the fly. The business requirements were not very detailed, so we have some design liberties. They DID say that they need to distinguish between Material Costs, Labor Costs, and All Inclusive costs, and that a project could have one or many of these “line items”.

### Success Criteria:​ Fulcrum representative can open/access a clickable user interface that demonstrates your abilities as a front-end developer.

### Assessment Criteria:
 - Overall process to achieve a UI/UX that someone would use
  - How do you communicate?
  - How do you gather more information/feedback?
  - How do you present ideas around UI/UX?
  - How do you collaborate?
 - Overall design
  - Styling principles and attention to detail
  - Usability
  - Efficiency
  - Responsiveness (if necessary)
 - Overall Code Quality
  - Cleanliness
  - Organization
  - Implementing best practice

### Constraints:​ None - solve the problem the way you would in the real world. Use any tool, framework, library, code-base, etc. (Hint: Don’t reinvent the wheel! We’re looking for general skills and instincts...if it takes you 1 hour or 1 week, it won’t benefit you either way, the final product is all that matters). With one exception - don’t plagiarize!

### Details:​ Thereisnoneedtotietoexistingdataarchitecture,soyoucanhard-codea sample data set, or store data locally in your application to retain the experience (it does NOT have to persist for this exercise). We should allow the field technicians to create a new estimate, add/edit line items, and show a total as the estimate is built. Hitting “Create Estimate” will begin your mission and “Save” will mark the end of your mission. If you require any other details or desire to collaborate in any way on design, please email jon.hill@fulcrumcollaborations, or schedule a 30 minute discussion to ask questions and collaborate.
