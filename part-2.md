## Suggested Changes

1. Font size across the board is too small. There is quite a bit of unused space in the table so increasing the font size to ~14px might help readability.

2. Tying into 1, there is a lot of empty space in the description field. Could easily shrink by about 1/3 and just wrap text as needed since it's already being pushed to occupy two lines by the actions column.

3. The Exit button is too small. It should match the "Create New" size

4. There isn't enough space between the search bar and the "Create New" button

5. The heading content should be left justified (training site + table tabs) and "Exit" should be right justified. Currently there's a large gap to the left of the heading content, and the exit button overhangs the table - see "misaligned.png" inside of the images directory

6. There doesn't seem to be a consistent rule to how much margin is added between different components. 

7. While looking at the margin differences, I noticed the search and create new buttons don't line up with the text on the left.
